The aim of the project is to apply the skills learned in the Coursera course ( IBM Data Analyst) to find the safest neighborhood in Seattle in terms of crime rate, surrounded by amenities. This will be determined by analyzing the number of crimes per neighborhood, clustering neighborhoods using k-means, and exploring the top common venues in the safest neighborhoods.

This exercise may also be of interest to anyone living in an expensive city in the US, looking to move to Seattle, Washington.
